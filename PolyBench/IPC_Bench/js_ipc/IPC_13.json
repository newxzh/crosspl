  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that makes an HTTP POST request to a specified URL with custom headers and data, then handles the response.\n\nFunction Description: The function `makeHttpRequest` sends an HTTP POST request to a given URL with specified headers and a data payload. It uses the `request` module to perform the HTTP request and includes a callback function to handle the response or errors. The function is designed to be reusable for making HTTP POST requests with minimal configuration.\n\nInput: \n- None (The URL, headers, and data are hardcoded within the function for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, these could be passed as parameters.)\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function logs the response body to the console if the request is successful. In a real-world scenario, the response could be returned or processed further.)\n\nNote: The function assumes the `request` module is available in the environment. If not, it must be installed via npm or another package manager.",
