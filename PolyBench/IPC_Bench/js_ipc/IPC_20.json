  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a class that handles the downloading and installation of binary packages from a specified URL, including directory management and error handling.\n\nClass Description: The Binary class is responsible for downloading a binary package from a given URL, extracting it to a specified directory, and managing the installation process. It handles directory creation, file extraction, and provides feedback on the installation status.\n\nAttributes:\n- url: [String] - The URL from which the binary package will be downloaded.\n- name: [String] - The name of the binary package (optional, defaults to -1).\n- installDirectory: [String] - The base directory where the binary will be installed (optional, defaults to a 'bin' subdirectory in the current working directory).\n- binaryDirectory: [String] - The full path to the directory where the binary will be extracted (initialized as -1, set during installation).\n- binaryPath: [String] - The full path to the binary file (initialized as -1, not used in current implementation).\n\nMethods:\n- constructor(url, data) -> [None] - Initializes the Binary instance with the download URL and optional configuration data (name and installDirectory).\n- install() -> [Promise] - Handles the complete installation process including directory preparation, downloading, extraction, and cleanup. Returns a Promise that resolves when installation is complete or rejects on error.\n  - Internal method _getInstallDirectory() is used to determine the installation directory path.",
