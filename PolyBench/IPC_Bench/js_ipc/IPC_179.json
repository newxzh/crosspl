  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that sets up a TCP server using Node.js's built-in 'net' module to handle client connections and respond with the current timestamp.\n\nFunction Description: The function creates a TCP server that listens on a specified port. When a client connects, the server sends the current timestamp and immediately closes the connection. The server continues to listen for new connections after handling each client.\n\nInput: \n- port: [number] - The port number on which the TCP server should listen for incoming connections.\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function creates and starts the server but doesn't return anything. The server continues running to handle connections.)",
