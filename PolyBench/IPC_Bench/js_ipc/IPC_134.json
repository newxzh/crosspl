  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that sets up a simple HTTP server to pipe the contents of a file as a response to incoming requests.\n\nFunction Description: The function creates an HTTP server that listens on a specified port. When a request is received, it responds by streaming the contents of a specified file to the client using the `pipe()` method. This is useful for efficiently serving file contents without loading the entire file into memory.\n\nInput: \n- port: [number] - The port number on which the HTTP server should listen. This is passed as the first command-line argument (process.argv[2]).\n- filePath: [string] - The path to the file whose contents should be piped to the response. This is passed as the second command-line argument (process.argv[3]).\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function does not return a value but starts an HTTP server that runs indefinitely.)",
