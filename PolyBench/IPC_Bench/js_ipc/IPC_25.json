  "Instruction": "Task Description: Write a function that retrieves TV channel data from a specified URL, processes the data to extract relevant channel information, and returns it in a structured format.\n\nFunction Description: The function `getChannels` asynchronously fetches TV channel data from a remote API endpoint using HTTP GET request. It processes the response to extract channel details such as language, site ID, and name, then returns them as an array of objects. Error handling is included to log any issues during the request.\n\nInput: None (The function does not take any input parameters; it uses a hardcoded URL for the API endpoint.)\n\nOutput: An array of objects, where each object represents a TV channel with the following properties:\n- `lang`: [String] - The language of the channel (e.g., 'lv').\n- `site_id`: [String] - The unique identifier/slug for the channel.\n- `name`: [String] - The display name of the channel.\n\nIf an error occurs during the HTTP request, the error will be logged to the console, and the function may return an empty array or undefined depending on the error handling flow.",
