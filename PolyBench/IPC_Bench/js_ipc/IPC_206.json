  "Instruction": "The provided reference code is at the function level, so I'll structure the instruction accordingly:\n\nTask Description: Implement a WebSocket client that automatically reconnects on connection loss and triggers a page reload when receiving a message.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes a WebSocket connection to the specified URL. It handles connection closure by automatically attempting to reconnect after a delay (2 seconds). When a message is received through the WebSocket, it triggers a full page reload. This is useful for implementing live-reload functionality during development or for real-time updates in web applications.\n\nInput: \n- a: [String] - The WebSocket server URL to connect to (e.g., \"ws://localhost:8080\")\n\nOutput: \n- None (the function doesn't return anything, but has side effects of managing WebSocket connection and page reloading)",
  "Canonical_solution": "function b(a) {\n    var c = new WebSocket(a);\n    c.onclose = function() {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            b(a)\n        }, 2E3)\n    };\n    c.onmessage = function() {\n        location.reload()\n    }\n}",
