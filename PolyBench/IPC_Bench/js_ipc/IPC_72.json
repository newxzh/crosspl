  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function to set up an Express server with webpack middleware for development purposes, serving a single-page application.\n\nFunction Description: The function `setupExpressServer` initializes an Express application, configures webpack development and hot-reload middleware, sets up a catch-all route to serve the main HTML file, and starts the server on localhost port 3000. This is typically used in development environments for frontend applications bundled with webpack.\n\nInput: None (The function doesn't take any explicit parameters, but assumes the existence of `compiler` and `config` variables in its scope, which would typically be webpack compiler instance and configuration object respectively)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return anything but starts an HTTP server that listens on port 3000)",
