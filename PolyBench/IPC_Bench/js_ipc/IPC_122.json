  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that uploads a file to a server using HTTP POST request with streaming capability to efficiently handle large files.\n\nFunction Description: The function `uploadFileViaPipe` streams a file from the local filesystem to an HTTP server using Node.js's built-in `fs` and `http` modules. It utilizes the pipe mechanism to efficiently transfer data without loading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for large files. The function assumes a predefined server port and file path.\n\nInput: \n- None (The function uses hardcoded values for demonstration purposes. In a real implementation, these would typically be parameters.)\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function performs a side effect of uploading a file. Success or failure would typically be handled via callbacks or events in a production implementation.)",
