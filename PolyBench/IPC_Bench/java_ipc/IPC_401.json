  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Java class that implements TCP client functionality for establishing a connection to a server, sending messages, and closing the connection.\n\nClass Description: The `SocketConnectTest` class provides basic TCP client capabilities using Java's Socket and I/O classes. It handles connection establishment, message transmission, and resource cleanup.\n\nAttributes:\n- client: [Socket] - The socket object representing the connection to the server\n- writer: [Writer] - The output stream writer for sending data to the server\n\nMethods:\n- connect: [connect(String host, int port)] -> [void] - Establishes a connection to the specified server host and port, initializing the socket and writer\n- sendMessage: [sendMessage(String message)] -> [void] - Sends the specified message to the connected server\n- close: [close()] -> [void] - Closes the writer and socket connection, releasing system resources",
