  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function to test if a given URL is reachable by making an HTTP GET request and verifying the response code.\n\nFunction Description: The function attempts to connect to a specified URL using an HTTP GET request. It checks if the response code is HTTP_OK (200) to determine if the URL is reachable. The connection is properly closed after the check.\n\nInput: \n- strUrl: String - The URL to be tested for reachability\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function throws an exception if the URL is unreachable or if the response code is not HTTP_OK)",
