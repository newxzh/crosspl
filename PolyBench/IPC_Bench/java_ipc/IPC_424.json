  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Java class that implements a TCP client using Java's Socket API for establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and managing the connection state.\n\nClass Description: The SocketClient class is a singleton implementation that provides TCP client functionality. It manages a single socket connection, handles data transmission through input/output streams, and maintains connection state. The class includes methods for opening/closing connections, reading/writing data, and checking connection status.\n\nAttributes:\n- socketClient: [SocketClient] - Singleton instance of the class\n- socket: [Socket] - The TCP socket connection\n- outputStream: [OutputStream] - Output stream for sending data\n- inputStream: [InputStream] - Input stream for receiving data\n- isConnected: [boolean] - Connection status flag\n- DEFAULT_READ_BUFFER_SIZE: [int] - Default buffer size for reading data (32KB)\n- buffer: [byte[]] - Temporary buffer for reading data\n- receivedData: [byte[]] - Storage for received data\n\nMethods:\n- getInstance() -> [SocketClient] - Returns the singleton instance of SocketClient\n- openConnection(String ip, int port) -> [void] - Opens a connection to the specified IP and port\n- isConnected() -> [boolean] - Returns the current connection status\n- write(byte[] data) -> [void] - Synchronously writes data to the output stream\n- read(int bytesToBeRead) -> [int] - Synchronously reads specified number of bytes from input stream\n- getReceivedData() -> [byte[]] - Returns the last received data\n- closeConnection() -> [void] - Closes the current connection and cleans up resources",
