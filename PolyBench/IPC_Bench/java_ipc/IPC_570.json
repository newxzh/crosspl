  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a POP3 client connection class in Java that handles socket communication with a POP3 server, including connection establishment, data transmission, and resource cleanup.\n\nClass Description: The Pop3Connection class provides functionality to connect to a POP3 server using TCP sockets, send and receive data through input/output streams, and manage the connection lifecycle.\n\nAttributes:\n- socket: Socket - The TCP socket used for communication with the server\n- in: BufferedInputStream - Input stream for reading data from the server\n- out: BufferedOutputStream - Output stream for writing data to the server\n\nMethods:\n- connect() -> Socket - Establishes a connection to the POP3 server by trying all available IP addresses for the host\n- connectToAddress(InetAddress address) -> Socket - Creates and connects a socket to a specific server address\n- open() -> void - Opens the connection by initializing socket and streams, throws MessagingException on failure\n- isOpen() -> boolean - Checks if the connection is currently active and valid\n- close() -> void - Closes all connection resources (socket and streams)\n- writeLine(String s) -> void - Writes a line of text to the server (appends CRLF)\n- readLine() -> String - Reads a line of text from the server (handles CRLF line endings)",
