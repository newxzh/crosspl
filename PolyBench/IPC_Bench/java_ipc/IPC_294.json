  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Java class that manages the execution of external processes, handles their input/output streams, and provides mechanisms for process termination and output handling through callbacks.\n\nClass Description: The ProcessExecutor class is responsible for executing external processes using ProcessBuilder, managing their lifecycle, and providing real-time output handling through a callback interface. It uses a thread pool for asynchronous execution and includes methods for graceful termination.\n\nAttributes:\n- mProcessBuilder: ProcessBuilder - Configures and manages the external process to be executed\n- mProcess: Process - Represents the currently running external process instance\n- mExecutor: ThreadPoolExecutor - Manages the thread used for asynchronous process execution\n\nMethods:\n- ProcessExecutor(Path scriptPath, Path libraryPath) -> void - Constructor that initializes the ProcessBuilder with the given script and library paths\n- execute(ProcessOutputHandler outputHandler) -> void - Starts the external process asynchronously and handles its output through the provided callback interface\n- terminate() -> void - Terminates the running process and shuts down the executor service\n- interface ProcessOutputHandler - Callback interface for handling process output, completion, and errors\n  - handleOutput(String output) -> void - Called for each line of output from the process\n  - handleCompletion(int exitCode) -> void - Called when the process completes with its exit code\n  - handleError(String errorMessage) -> void - Called when an error occurs during process execution",
