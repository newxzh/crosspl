  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a TCP client class in Java that can connect to a server, send messages, receive responses, and properly close the connection.\n\nClass Description: The SocketClient class provides functionality for establishing a TCP connection to a server, sending messages, receiving responses, and managing connection resources. It encapsulates the socket communication logic using Java's IO and networking classes.\n\nAttributes:\n- theSocket: Socket - The socket object representing the connection to the server\n- out: PrintWriter - The output stream writer for sending data to the server\n- networkIn: BufferedReader - The input stream reader for receiving data from the server\n\nMethods:\n- connect(String host, int port) -> void - Establishes a connection to the specified server host and port. Throws IOException if connection fails.\n- sendMessage(String message) -> void - Sends a message to the connected server. The message is automatically flushed.\n- readResponse() -> String - Reads a line of response from the server. Throws IOException if reading fails.\n- close() -> void - Closes all connection resources (socket, input and output streams) safely. Handles any IOExceptions internally.",
