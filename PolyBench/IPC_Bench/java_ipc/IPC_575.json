  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a Java class that establishes a TCP client connection to a server, sends a command, and retrieves the server's response using socket programming.\n\nClass Description: The FourLetterCommand class provides functionality to connect to a server, send a command string, and receive the server's response. It handles socket creation, connection, data transmission, and resource cleanup.\n\nAttributes:\n- host: String - The hostname or IP address of the server to connect to\n- port: int - The port number on which the server is listening\n\nMethods:\n- FourLetterCommand(String host, int port) -> None - Constructor that initializes the host and port attributes\n- request(String command) -> String - Establishes a connection to the server, sends the command, and returns the server's response\n- response(Socket client) -> String - Reads the server's response from the socket input stream and returns it as a string\n- cleanup(Closeable c) -> void - Closes the provided Closeable resource (socket or stream) and handles any IOExceptions silently",
