  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a WebSocket server endpoint in Java that handles binary data communication asynchronously using ByteBuffer.\n\nClass Description: This class represents a WebSocket server endpoint that receives binary data from clients and echoes it back asynchronously. The endpoint is mapped to the \"/bytebuffer\" path and uses Java's WebSocket API for communication.\n\nAttributes: None\n\nMethods:\n- echoByteBuffer(ByteBuffer data, Session session) -> void - Handles incoming binary messages from WebSocket clients. Receives the binary data as a ByteBuffer and the client's Session object, then asynchronously sends the same data back to the client. The method uses the session's async remote endpoint to send the response without blocking.\n\nInput:\n- data: ByteBuffer - The binary data received from the client\n- session: Session - The WebSocket session object representing the client connection\n\nOutput: None (The method sends data back to the client through the session object but doesn't return anything)",
