When a request is made to the root path, it responds by setting a cookie named \"my-cookie\" with the value \"some value\".\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters; it handles incoming HTTP requests)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return any value; it runs an HTTP server indefinitely until interrupted)",
