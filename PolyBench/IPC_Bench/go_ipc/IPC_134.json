    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Go function that sets up a basic HTTP server using the Gin framework, with routes for login and home pages, including cookie handling for authentication.\n\nFunction Description: The function initializes a Gin web server with default middleware (Logger and Recovery), defines two routes (/login and /home), and starts the server on port 8080. The /login route sets a cookie, while the /home route requires cookie authentication through middleware and returns JSON data.\n\nInput: None (The function takes no input parameters as it's the main entry point)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return anything but starts an HTTP server that listens indefinitely)\n\nNote: The CookieTool() middleware referenced in the home route would need to be defined separately to verify the cookie set by the login route.",
