    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a simple HTTP server using the Gin framework in Go that serves static files from a local directory and handles a basic GET request.\n\nFunction Description: The main function initializes a Gin HTTP server with default middleware (Logger and Recovery), sets up static file serving from a specified directory, registers a GET route handler, and starts the server on a specified port.\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters, but the server configuration is hardcoded in the function)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return any value but starts an HTTP server that continues running until interrupted)\n\nNote: The static file directory (\"/tmp\") and server port (\":8080\") are hardcoded in this implementation but could be made configurable through parameters in a more flexible version.",
