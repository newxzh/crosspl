    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a simple HTTP server using the Gin framework in Go that serves static files from a local directory and handles a basic GET request.\n\nFunction Description: The main function initializes a Gin HTTP server with default middleware (Logger and Recovery), sets up static file serving from a specified directory, registers a GET route handler, and starts the server on a specified port.\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters, but configuration is hardcoded: static files are served from \"/tmp\" and the server listens on port 8080)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return anything but starts an HTTP server that continues running until interrupted)",
