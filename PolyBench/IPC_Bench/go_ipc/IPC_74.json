    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a basic HTTP server in Go that handles requests to the root path (\"/\") and returns a \"Hello World\" message.\n\nFunction Description: The `handler` function is an HTTP request handler that writes a \"Hello World\" response to the client. It is registered to handle requests to the root path (\"/\") and is executed when a request is received. The server listens on port 8080.\n\nInput:  \n- `w http.ResponseWriter`: Used to construct the HTTP response.  \n- `r *http.Request`: Contains information about the incoming HTTP request.  \n\nOutput:  \n- The function writes \"Hello World, I'm Golang!\" to the `http.ResponseWriter`, which is sent as the HTTP response body. No explicit return value.  \n\nExample usage:  \n```go\nhttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", handler)  \nhttp.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)  \n```",
