    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a simple HTTP server in Go using the Gin framework that handles file uploads via POST requests.\n\nFunction Description: The function sets up a Gin HTTP server with a single POST endpoint (\"/upload\") that receives and discards uploaded file data, then responds with \"ok\". The server runs on port 8888.\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters, but receives HTTP POST requests with file data in the request body)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return any value, but sends HTTP responses with status code 200 and body \"ok\" for successful uploads)",
