    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a basic HTTP server in Go that echoes back the request headers to the client. The server should handle requests on the root path (\"/\") and respond by writing the request headers to the response.\n\nFunction Description: The `ServeHTTP` function is an HTTP handler that writes the request headers to the response writer. It is registered to handle requests on the root path (\"/\") and starts an HTTP server listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`.\n\nInput: \n- `w http.ResponseWriter`: Used to construct the HTTP response.\n- `r *http.Request`: Contains the incoming HTTP request details, including headers.\n\nOutput: None (writes directly to the `http.ResponseWriter`).",
