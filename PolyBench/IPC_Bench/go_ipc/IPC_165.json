    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a simple HTTP server using the Gin framework in Go that responds to GET requests with a basic message.\n\nFunction Description: The main function initializes a Gin router with default middleware (Logger and Recovery), sets up a GET route handler at the \"/ping\" endpoint that responds with \"pong\", and starts the server on the default port (8080).\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters, but handles incoming HTTP GET requests to the \"/ping\" endpoint)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return any value, but sends \"pong\" as a response to GET requests at \"/ping\" and runs the HTTP server continuously until interrupted)",
