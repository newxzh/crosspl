    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a basic HTTP server in Go that handles requests to the root path (\"/\") and returns a \"Hello World\" message.\n\nFunction Description: The `handler` function is an HTTP request handler that writes a \"Hello World\" response to the client. It is registered to handle requests to the root path (\"/\") and starts an HTTP server listening on port 8080.\n\nInput: \n- `w http.ResponseWriter` - Used to write the HTTP response.\n- `r *http.Request` - Represents the HTTP request received from the client.\n\nOutput: \n- The function writes \"Hello World, I'm Golang!\" to the `http.ResponseWriter`, which is sent as the HTTP response to the client. There is no explicit return value.",
