    "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a WebSocket handler function in Go that upgrades an HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection, sends a greeting message to the client, and echoes back any messages received from the client.\n\nFunction Description: The function `hello` handles WebSocket communication by upgrading an HTTP request to a WebSocket connection using the Gorilla WebSocket upgrader. It then enters a loop where it sends a greeting message to the client and reads messages from the client, printing them to the console. The connection is properly closed when the function exits.\n\nInput: \n- `c echo.Context`: An Echo framework context object representing the HTTP request and response. This is used to access the underlying HTTP connection for WebSocket upgrade.\n\nOutput: \n- `error`: Returns an error if the WebSocket upgrade fails or if there is an error during message reading/writing. Otherwise, it returns nil once the connection is closed.\n\nNote: The function runs indefinitely in a loop until the WebSocket connection is closed or an error occurs.",
