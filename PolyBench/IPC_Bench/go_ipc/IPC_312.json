It handles errors during the request or reading process and ensures the response body is properly closed to prevent resource leaks.\n\nInput: \n- url (string): The URL to which the HTTP GET request will be sent.\n\nOutput: \n- ([]byte, error): A byte slice containing the response body if the request is successful, or an error if the request fails or the response body cannot be read.",
