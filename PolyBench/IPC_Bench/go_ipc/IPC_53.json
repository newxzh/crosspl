    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that sets up and starts an HTTP server with health check and metrics endpoints using Go's net/http package.\n\nFunction Description: The function `serveMetrics` initializes an HTTP server with two endpoints: `/healthz` for health checks (returns \"OK\" with 200 status) and `/metrics` for Prometheus metrics (handled by promhttp). The server listens on the specified address and runs until terminated.\n\nInput: \n- `address` (string): The network address (including port) on which the HTTP server should listen (e.g., \":8080\")\n\nOutput: \n- None (function runs indefinitely until server termination)\n- Logs fatal errors if server fails to start",
