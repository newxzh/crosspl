    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that handles WebSocket connections by upgrading HTTP connections, reading incoming messages, and forwarding them to a channel for further processing.\n\nFunction Description: The function `makeUpgradeOnConnect` generates and returns an HTTP handler function that upgrades incoming HTTP connections to WebSocket connections. It reads messages from the WebSocket connection and sends them to a provided channel. The WebSocket connection is properly closed when processing is complete.\n\nInput: \n- `ch chan string`: A channel of strings used to forward incoming WebSocket messages for further processing.\n\nOutput: \n- Returns a function of type `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` that serves as an HTTP handler for WebSocket connections.\n\nNote: The returned HTTP handler function does not explicitly return any value but handles WebSocket communication and message forwarding internally.",
