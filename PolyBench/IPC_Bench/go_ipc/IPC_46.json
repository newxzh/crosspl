    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a simple HTTP server in Go that responds to requests with a greeting message containing the value of the \"AUTHOR\" environment variable.\n\nFunction Description: The main function sets up a basic HTTP server with a single route (\"/\") that responds to all HTTP requests. The response is a plain text message combining \"hello \" with the value of the \"AUTHOR\" environment variable. The server listens on a specified port.\n\nInput: \n- *addr (string pointer): A command-line flag specifying the server address and port to listen on (e.g., \":8080\")\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function runs indefinitely, serving HTTP requests until interrupted)\n- For each HTTP request to \"/\", outputs \"hello [AUTHOR]\" as the response body\n\nNote: The function does not explicitly return any values but writes to the http.ResponseWriter for each incoming request. The server continues running until terminated.",
