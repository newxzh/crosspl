    "Instruction": "Task Description: The task involves creating a WebSocket client in Go that establishes multiple concurrent connections to a WebSocket server, maintains these connections, and handles incoming messages. The client should be able to gracefully handle connection errors and properly close connections when done.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes WebSocket connections to a specified server endpoint with unique identifiers, maintains these connections in separate goroutines, and continuously reads incoming messages. Each connection includes user identification and authentication parameters in the URL query string.\n\nInput: \n- None (The function uses hardcoded values for demonstration, but could be modified to accept parameters like host, port, path, and connection count)\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function primarily logs its activities and errors to stdout)\n\nNote: The function runs indefinitely until 100,000 connections are established (for testing purposes), with each connection attempt spaced by 1 second. Each connection runs in its own goroutine and includes error handling for both connection establishment and message reading.",
