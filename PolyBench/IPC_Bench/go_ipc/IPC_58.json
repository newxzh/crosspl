    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a simple HTTP server in Go that handles form submissions and displays the submitted value. The server should respond to both GET and POST requests on the root path (\"/\") and render an HTML form with a checkbox input.\n\nFunction Description: The main function sets up an HTTP server with a single route handler for the root path (\"/\"). The handler processes form submissions, extracts the form value, and returns an HTML response containing the form and the submitted value.\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters. Input is received through HTTP requests.)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return any value. Output is sent through the HTTP response writer.)\n\nNote: The function internally uses http.ResponseWriter to send responses and *http.Request to receive requests. The handler checks for a form value with key \"q\" and includes it in the response. The server listens on port 9000.",
