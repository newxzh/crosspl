    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Go HTTP server that acts as a proxy, forwarding requests based on a header value and returning the corresponding stored response.\n\nFunction Description: The main function sets up an HTTP server with a root handler that retrieves and forwards responses based on the \"proxify\" header. It stores responses in a global map and cleans up after forwarding. The server runs concurrently.\n\nInput: \n- options.HTTPListenerAddress (string): The address and port on which the HTTP server should listen (e.g., \":8080\")\n\nOutput: \n- None (the function runs indefinitely as a server)\n- Errors are logged fatally if the server fails to start\n\nNote: The implementation uses global variables (response and responses) for storing and retrieving HTTP responses. The handler expects requests to contain a \"proxify\" header that serves as a key to look up pre-stored responses in the responses map. After forwarding a response, it removes the corresponding entry from the map.",
