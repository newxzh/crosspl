    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a basic HTTP server in Go that handles requests to the root path (\"/\") and returns a \"Hello World\" message.\n\nFunction Description: The `handler` function is an HTTP request handler that writes a \"Hello World\" response to the client. It is registered to handle requests to the root path (\"/\") and is executed when the server receives a request to that path.\n\nInput: \n- `w http.ResponseWriter` - Used to write the HTTP response back to the client.\n- `r *http.Request` - Contains information about the incoming HTTP request (not used in this simple example).\n\nOutput: \n- The function writes \"Hello World, I'm Golang!\" to the response writer (`w`), which is sent back to the client. There is no explicit return value.",
