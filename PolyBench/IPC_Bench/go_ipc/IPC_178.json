If the connection fails, it should panic with the error.\n\nInput: \n- address (string): The server address in the format \"host:port\" (e.g., \"localhost:9000\")\n\nOutput: \n- string: The data received from the server\n- error: Returns an error if the connection or read operation fails (though in the reference code it panics on connection error)",
