    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that implements a basic HTTP server which echoes back the request body to the response.\n\nFunction Description: The function `httpserver` starts an HTTP server on the specified address. It handles all incoming requests to the root path (\"/\") by copying the request body directly to the response writer. This effectively echoes back the received data to the client. The server runs until an error occurs or is manually stopped.\n\nInput:  \n- `addr` (string): The network address (including port) on which the HTTP server should listen (e.g., \":8080\").\n\nOutput:  \n- `error`: Returns an error if the server fails to start or encounters a fatal error during operation. Returns nil if the server is terminated gracefully.",
