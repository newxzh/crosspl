    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create an HTTP server using the Echo framework in Go, which includes route handling, middleware integration, and JWT-based authentication for restricted routes.\n\nFunction Description: The main function initializes an Echo server, configures middleware (logger and recovery), sets up routes for login and accessible content, and creates a restricted route group with JWT authentication. The server listens on port 1323.\n\nInput: None (The function takes no direct input parameters, but relies on HTTP requests to trigger route handlers)\n\nOutput: None (The function doesn't return any value but starts an HTTP server that continues running until interrupted)\n\nNote: The actual route handlers (login, accessible, restricted) would need to be implemented separately as they're referenced but not shown in the provided code.",
