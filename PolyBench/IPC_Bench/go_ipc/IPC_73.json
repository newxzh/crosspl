It includes a handler function to process requests, sets up an HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, and starts both HTTP and HTTPS servers concurrently.\n\nInput:\n- Port numbers for HTTP (9999) and HTTPS (10443) servers\n- TLS certificate files (\"cert.pem\" and \"key.pem\")\n- HTTP request objects (*http.Request) for the handler function\n\nOutput:\n- HTTP responses (through http.ResponseWriter)\n- Server logs indicating server status and errors\n- Automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection (301 Moved Permanently)\n\nMethods:\n1. handler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) - Processes incoming requests and writes a plain text response\n2. main() - Configures and starts the HTTP and HTTPS servers, including the redirect handler",
