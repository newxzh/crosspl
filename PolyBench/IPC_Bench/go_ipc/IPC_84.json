    "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a basic HTTP server in Go that handles multiple routes with different response messages.\n\nFunction Description: The code demonstrates how to set up a simple HTTP server with two route handlers. The first handler responds to the root path (\"/\") with a \"doggy\" message, while the second handler responds to the \"/cat/\" path with a \"catty\" message. The server listens on port 9000.\n\nInput: \n- None (HTTP requests are automatically handled by the server)\n\nOutput: \n- None (The server writes responses directly to the http.ResponseWriter)\n\nMethods:\n- upTown: Handles requests to the root path (\"/\") and writes \"doggy doggy doggy\" to the response\n- youUp: Handles requests to the \"/cat/\" path and writes \"catty catty catty\" to the response\n- main: Registers the route handlers and starts the HTTP server on port 9000",
