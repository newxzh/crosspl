  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP server in C++ that listens for incoming connections, handles client requests in separate child processes, and responds to clients after processing their data.\n\nFunction Description: The function `tcp_server_communication` creates a TCP server that binds to a specified port, listens for incoming connections, and forks child processes to handle each client connection. Each child process reads a character from the client, increments it after a delay, and sends it back before terminating.\n\nInput: None (The function uses predefined constants: port number 9736 and INADDR_ANY for binding to all available network interfaces)\n\nOutput: None (The function runs indefinitely, servicing client requests and doesn't return any value)\n\nNote: The function includes signal handling to prevent zombie processes from terminated child processes. Each client connection is handled in a separate child process while the parent process continues to accept new connections.",
