  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP client function in C++ that establishes a connection to a server, sends a single character, receives a response, and then closes the connection.\n\nFunction Description: The function `tcp_client_communication` creates a TCP socket, connects to a specified server address and port, sends a predefined character ('A') to the server, reads the server's response, prints the received character, and finally closes the socket. This demonstrates basic TCP client functionality using BSD sockets.\n\nInput: None (The server address and port are hardcoded as 127.0.0.1:9736 in the function)\n\nOutput: \n- Returns 0 on successful execution\n- Prints the received character from the server\n- Exits with error code 1 if connection fails",
