  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP client function in C++ that establishes a connection to a server, sends user input to the server, and prints the server's response. The function should handle basic error cases and properly close the connection when done.\n\nFunction Description: The function `tcp_client_communication` creates a TCP socket, connects to a specified server, and enters a loop where it reads user input, sends it to the server, and displays the server's response. The loop continues until an error occurs or the connection is closed by the server. The function handles socket creation, connection, data transmission, and cleanup.\n\nInput: None (The server IP address and port are hardcoded as \"127.0.0.1\" and 1234 respectively in the function)\n\nOutput: None (The function prints server responses to stdout but doesn't return any value)",
