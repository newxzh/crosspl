  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Flask-based HTTP server endpoint that processes credit card application data and returns a prediction result indicating the probability of approval and a binary decision.\n\nFunction Description: The function implements a prediction endpoint for a credit card approval system. It receives client data in JSON format, processes it through a machine learning model (using pre-loaded `dv` for feature transformation and `model` for prediction), and returns the prediction results including the approval probability and a binary decision.\n\nInput: \n- JSON payload containing client data for credit card application (received via HTTP POST request)\n\nOutput: \n- JSON response containing:\n  - 'get_card_probability': float - Probability of getting the credit card (between 0 and 1)\n  - 'get_card': boolean - Binary decision indicating whether the card is approved (True if probability \u2265 0.5)",
