  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a UDP server that listens for incoming messages on a specified IP address and port, processes the received data, and terminates when a specific exit command is received.\n\nFunction Description: The function `udp_server` creates a UDP socket, binds it to a local IP address and port, and continuously listens for incoming messages. It processes the received data by decoding it from bytes to a UTF-8 string and checks for an exit command to terminate the loop. The socket is closed once the loop exits.\n\nInput: None\n\nOutput: None",
