  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a Kafka producer function that reads data from a CSV file and sends it as JSON messages to a specified Kafka topic, with proper resource management and message delivery guarantees.\n\nFunction Description: The function reads movie rating data from a CSV file, converts each record into a JSON message, and publishes these messages to a designated Kafka topic. It includes a 30-second initial delay (to ensure Kafka broker availability), configures the producer with appropriate settings, sends messages with a small delay between them, and properly closes the producer after sending all messages. A special \"*COMMIT*\" message is sent as the final message to indicate completion.\n\nInput: None (The function uses a hardcoded CSV file path \"./dataset.csv\" and Kafka broker address \"kafka:9092\")\n\nOutput: None (The function's effect is the messages sent to the Kafka topic, not a direct return value)",
