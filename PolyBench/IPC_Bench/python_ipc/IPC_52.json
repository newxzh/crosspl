  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create an asynchronous function to send an HTTP POST request with candidate and role data to a specified endpoint, and return the response as a dictionary.\n\nFunction Description: The function uses httpx.AsyncClient to asynchronously send a POST request containing candidate information and role details to a server endpoint. It handles the response by converting it to JSON format and returns the result. The function is designed to be non-blocking and should be called within an async context.\n\nInput:\n- candidates: list[dict] - A list of candidate dictionaries, each containing:\n  - name: str - The candidate's name\n  - self_identified_seniority: int - The candidate's self-assessed seniority level\n  - bio: str - The candidate's biography/description\n- role: dict - A dictionary containing role details:\n  - title: str - The job title\n  - desired_seniority: int - The desired seniority level for the role\n  - description: str - The job description\n\nOutput:\n- dict - The JSON-decoded response from the server containing the processed results",
