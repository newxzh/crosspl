  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that establishes a TCP connection to a server, receives initial data from the server, sends a buffer with a specific prefix, and handles connection errors gracefully.\n\nFunction Description: The function `send_buffer_to_server` creates a TCP socket, connects to a specified server, receives initial data, sends a buffer prefixed with \"GMON /\", and ensures proper connection closure. It includes error handling for connection issues.\n\nInput:\n- host: [str] - The IP address or hostname of the target server\n- port: [int] - The port number on which the server is listening\n- buffer: [str] - The data buffer to be sent to the server (will be prefixed with \"GMON /\")\n\nOutput:\n- None (prints status messages to console: received data, error messages, and confirmation of buffer sending)",
