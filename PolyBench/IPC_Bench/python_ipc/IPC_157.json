  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Flask-based HTTP server endpoint that receives JSON data, processes it using a pre-trained machine learning model, and returns predictions in JSON format.\n\nFunction Description: The function handles POST requests to the '/predict' endpoint. It receives JSON data, validates it, loads a pre-trained model, makes predictions, and returns the results. It also includes error handling for bad requests.\n\nInput: \n- HTTP POST request with JSON payload containing data for prediction\n- The function accesses this through Flask's request.get_json()\n\nOutput:\n- Successful case: JSON response containing prediction results with HTTP status code 200\n- Error case: JSON error message with HTTP status code 400 for bad requests",
