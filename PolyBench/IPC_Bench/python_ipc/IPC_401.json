  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a multithreaded TCP echo server that receives data from a client, processes it, and sends it back to the client in chunks. The server should handle client connections in a separate thread and support graceful termination when receiving a \"QUIT\" command.\n\nClass Description: EchoServer is a threaded TCP server that echoes received data back to the client. It handles one client connection at a time, processes incoming data, and sends it back in configurable chunk sizes. The server can be configured to delay resending until triggered by an external event.\n\nAttributes:\n- host: str - The host IP address to bind the server to\n- port: int - The port number to listen on\n- sock: socket.socket - The TCP socket object for server operations\n- buffer: str - Accumulates received data before echoing back\n- start_resend_event: threading.Event - Optional event to trigger when to start echoing data back\n- chunk_size: int - Size of data chunks to send back to client (default: 1 byte)\n\nMethods:\n- __init__(host: str, port: int) -> None - Initializes the server with host and port\n- run() -> None - Main thread method that handles client connection, data reception, and echoing back data. Runs in a separate thread when started. Processes data until \"QUIT\" is received or connection is closed.",
