  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that establishes an MQTT client connection to a broker, publishes messages to specified topics with a given QoS level, and handles connection and message events asynchronously.\n\nFunction Description: The function `mqtt_publish` initializes an MQTT client, sets up callback functions for connection, message reception, and message publishing events, connects to a specified MQTT broker, starts an asynchronous network loop, and publishes messages to designated topics with a QoS level of 2. The function demonstrates basic MQTT publishing capabilities with event handling.\n\nInput: None (The function uses hardcoded values for broker address, port, topics, and messages)\n\nOutput: None (The function's effects are side-effects: publishing messages and printing status information through callback functions)\n\nNote: The function includes three callback functions:\n1. `on_connect`: Prints the connection reason code when connected to the broker\n2. `on_message`: Prints received messages (though none are expected in this publish-only example)\n3. `on_publish`: Prints the message ID when a message is published",
