  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a TCP client function that establishes a connection to a server, sends a message, and receives a response.\n\nFunction Description: The function creates a TCP socket, connects to a specified server, sends a UTF-8 encoded message, receives a response, and then closes the connection. It handles the basic TCP client-server interaction.\n\nInput:\n- host: str - The IP address or hostname of the target server\n- port: int - The port number on which the server is listening\n- message: str - The message to be sent to the server\n\nOutput:\n- str - The decoded response received from the server",
