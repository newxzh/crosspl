  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a WebSocket server using FastAPI that validates user sessions by performing a bitwise operation on received user and session IDs.\n\nFunction Description: The function `websocket_endpoint` establishes a WebSocket connection, receives binary data containing user and session IDs, validates them using a specific bitwise operation, and sends back the validation result as binary data.\n\nInput: \n- websocket: WebSocket - The WebSocket connection object provided by FastAPI\n- data: bytes - Binary data received from the client containing packed user_id and session_id (two unsigned 32-bit integers in little-endian format)\n\nOutput: \n- None (The function sends binary data back through the WebSocket connection but doesn't return anything)\n- The sent data contains a packed unsigned 32-bit integer (little-endian) representing the validation result (1 for valid, 0 for invalid)",
