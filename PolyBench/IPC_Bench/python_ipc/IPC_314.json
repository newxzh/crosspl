  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that consumes messages from a RabbitMQ queue using the pika library, processing each message with a callback function.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes a connection to a RabbitMQ server, declares a durable queue, and starts consuming messages from the specified queue. Each received message is processed by a callback function that prints the message body. The function runs in a blocking mode, continuously waiting for messages until interrupted.\n\nInput:\n- port: [int] - The port number of the RabbitMQ server to connect to (default is typically 5672)\n\nOutput: None (The function runs indefinitely until interrupted, printing received messages to the console)",
