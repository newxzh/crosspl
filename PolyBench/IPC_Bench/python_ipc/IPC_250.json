  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a Kafka producer function that reads data from a file, sorts it by timestamp, and streams it to a Kafka topic at a controlled speed, with batch commit markers.\n\nFunction Description: The function reads JSON-formatted data from a file, extracts timestamps, sorts the data chronologically, and streams it to a specified Kafka topic. It maintains the original time intervals between records (adjusted by a speed factor) and inserts commit markers after each batch of records. Finally, it sends finish and commit markers before closing the producer.\n\nInput:\n- dataset_path: str - Path to the input file containing JSON records\n- speed: float (default=1) - Speed multiplier for time intervals (1.0 = realtime, 2.0 = 2x faster)\n- batch_size: float (default=500) - Number of records between commit markers\n\nOutput: None (Messages are sent to Kafka topic; no return value)",
