  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a TCP client class for establishing and managing connections to a server, sending requests, and receiving responses using HDLC framing protocol.\n\nClass Description: TcpConnector is a class that handles TCP communication with a server using IPv4. It manages socket connection, sends requests with HDLC encapsulation, and continuously reads incoming data with HDLC decapsulation.\n\nAttributes:\n- socket: [socket.socket] - TCP socket object for communication\n- received_first_packet: [bool] - Flag indicating if first packet was received\n- packet_buffer: [bytes] - Buffer for storing incoming data\n- TRAILER_CHAR: [bytes] - Class constant for HDLC frame delimiter (assumed to be defined elsewhere in class)\n\nMethods:\n- __init__(address: str, port: int) -> None - Initializes TCP connection to specified address and port\n- send_request(packet_type: int, packet_payload: bytes) -> None - Sends HDLC-encapsulated request to server\n- read_loop() -> None - Continuously reads and processes incoming data using HDLC framing\n- __del__() -> None - Cleans up by closing socket connection\n- hdlc_encapsulate(data: bytes) -> bytes - (Assumed method) HDLC encapsulation implementation\n- hdlc_decapsulate(payload: bytes) -> bytes - (Assumed method) HDLC decapsulation implementation\n- dispatch_received_diag_packet(unframed_message: bytes) -> None - (Assumed method) Handles processed packets",
