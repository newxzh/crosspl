  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP server in Python using the socketserver module to handle client requests, process data, and send responses back to the client.\n\nClass Description: The TCPServer class initializes and manages a TCP server that listens for client connections, processes incoming data, and sends appropriate responses. The EchoRequestHandler class handles individual client requests by processing received data and generating responses.\n\nAttributes:\n- port: int - The port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections.\n- server: socketserver.TCPServer - The instance of the TCP server that handles client connections.\n\nMethods:\n- __init__(port: int) -> None - Initializes the TCPServer instance with the specified port number.\n- start() -> None - Starts the TCP server, binds it to 'localhost' and the specified port, and begins listening for client connections indefinitely.\n- stop() -> None - Shuts down the TCP server if it is running.\n\nClass Description: The EchoRequestHandler class inherits from socketserver.BaseRequestHandler and defines how to handle incoming client requests.\n\nMethods:\n- handle() -> None - Processes the client's request by receiving data, decoding it, and performing actions based on the received data (either learning or classifying). It then sends a response back to the client. The method uses the following steps:\n  1. Receives data from the client using recv().\n  2. Decodes the data from UTF-8 format.\n  3. Parses the data to extract group and filename.\n  4. Depending on the presence of a filename, either performs a learning operation or a classification operation.\n  5. Encodes the result as JSON and sends it back to the client using send().",
