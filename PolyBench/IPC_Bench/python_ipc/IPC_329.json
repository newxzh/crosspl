  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP client function in Python that connects to a server, receives initial data, sends a formatted message, and handles connection errors gracefully.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes a TCP connection to a specified server, receives initial data from the server, sends a formatted message (prefixed with \"USV \" and suffixed with '\\r\\n\\r\\n'), and ensures proper connection closure. Error handling is included to manage connection issues.\n\nInput:\n- host: str - The IP address or hostname of the target server\n- port: int - The port number on which the server is listening\n- buffer: str - The message content to be sent to the server\n\nOutput:\n- None (prints received data and status messages to console)\n- Success: Prints \"Buffer Sent Successfully!\" upon completion\n- Failure: Prints \"Check your debugger\" if connection fails",
