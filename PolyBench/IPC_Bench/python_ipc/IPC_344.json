  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that establishes a TCP connection to a specified server, sends a payload consisting of a command and optional padding, and then closes the connection.\n\nFunction Description: The function `send_tcp_payload` creates a TCP socket, connects to a target server using the provided IP address and port, sends a payload formed by combining a command string with optional padding, and finally closes the socket connection. This is useful for simple TCP-based client-server communication scenarios.\n\nInput:\n- `ipaddr`: [str] - The IP address of the target server to connect to\n- `port`: [int] - The port number on the target server to connect to\n- `cmd`: [str] - The command string to be sent as part of the payload\n- `padding`: [str] - Optional additional data to be appended to the command\n\nOutput: None (The function performs an action but doesn't return any value)",
