  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP server that accepts client connections and delegates the handling of these connections to a worker process using inter-process communication (IPC).\n\nFunction Description: The function `server` establishes a TCP server that listens for incoming client connections. When a client connects, the server sends the client's file descriptor to a pre-connected worker process using `send_handle`, allowing the worker to take over the client communication. The server then closes its end of the connection, leaving the worker to handle further interaction with the client.\n\nInput:\n- `work_address`: [str] - The address (e.g., a named pipe or network address) where the worker process is listening for connections.\n- `port`: [int] - The TCP port number on which the server should listen for incoming client connections.\n\nOutput: None (The function runs indefinitely in a loop, accepting and delegating client connections.)",
