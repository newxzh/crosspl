  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement an MQTT subscriber function in Python that connects to a broker, subscribes to a topic, and processes incoming messages using the Paho MQTT client library.\n\nFunction Description: The function `mqtt_subscriber` establishes a connection to an MQTT broker over WebSockets, subscribes to a specified topic, and continuously listens for incoming messages. It utilizes callback functions to handle connection events, incoming messages, and subscription acknowledgments.\n\nInput: None (The broker address, port, and topic are hardcoded in the function for simplicity.)\n\nOutput: None (The function prints connection status, subscription acknowledgments, and received messages to the console.)\n\n---\n\nTask Description: Implement an MQTT subscriber class in Python that encapsulates the functionality of connecting to a broker, subscribing to topics, and processing incoming messages using the Paho MQTT client library.\n\nClass Description: The `MQTTSubscriber` class provides a reusable and configurable way to subscribe to MQTT topics. It initializes with broker details and topic configurations, and it uses callback methods to handle MQTT events such as connection, message reception, and subscription.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `client`: [mqtt.Client] - The Paho MQTT client instance used for communication.\n- `broker_address`: [str] - The address of the MQTT broker.\n- `broker_port`: [int] - The port number of the MQTT broker.\n- `topic`: [str] - The MQTT topic to subscribe to.\n- `qos`: [int] - The Quality of Service level for the subscription.\n\nMethods:\n\n- `__init__(broker_address: str, broker_port: int, topic: str, qos: int = 0) -> None` - Initializes the MQTT subscriber with broker details and topic configuration.\n- `on_connect(client: mqtt.Client, obj: Any, flags: dict, reason_code: int, properties: Any) -> None` - Callback for when the client connects to the broker.\n- `on_message(client: mqtt.Client, obj: Any, msg: mqtt.MQTTMessage) -> None` - Callback for when a message is received on the subscribed topic.\n- `on_subscribe(client: mqtt.Client, obj: Any, mid: int, reason_code_list: list, properties: Any) -> None` - Callback for when the client subscribes to a topic.\n- `start() -> None` - Connects to the broker, subscribes to the topic, and starts the MQTT loop to process messages.\n- `stop() -> None` - Stops the MQTT loop and disconnects from the broker.",
