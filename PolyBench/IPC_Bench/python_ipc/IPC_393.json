  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP server in Python that listens for incoming client connections, processes received commands, and sends responses back to the client. The server should handle multiple commands and arguments, and provide appropriate acknowledgments or negative acknowledgments based on command execution.\n\nFunction Description: The function `do_tcp_server` establishes a TCP server that listens on a specified port, accepts client connections, receives and processes commands, and sends responses. It uses a handler function to process commands and arguments, and manages the connection lifecycle.\n\nInput:\n- `client`: [Object] - A client object that provides a printer method for sending data.\n- `arguments`: [Dictionary] - A dictionary containing server configuration, including the port number under the key \"--tcpport\".\n- `handler`: [Function] - A callback function that processes commands and arguments. It takes two parameters: the command string and the parsed arguments, and returns a boolean indicating success (True for <ACK>, False for <NAK>).\n\nOutput:\n- None. The function runs indefinitely, handling client connections and commands until manually stopped. Responses are sent back to the client via the TCP connection.",
