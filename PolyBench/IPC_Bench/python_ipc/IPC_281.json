  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that runs a Python subprocess with pipe communication, compares the output with expected results from a JSON file, and asserts their equality.\n\nFunction Description: The function `run_subprocess_with_pipe` executes a Python subprocess with given arguments, captures its output through a pipe, and compares this output with expected results loaded from a JSON file. The comparison includes checking the length of the results and verifying that all elements match between the expected and actual outputs.\n\nInput:\n- `expected_file`: [str] - Path to the JSON file containing the expected output data.\n- `*args`: [variable arguments] - Additional command-line arguments to pass to the subprocess.\n\nOutput: None (The function performs assertions to validate the output against the expected results. If assertions fail, an AssertionError is raised.)",
