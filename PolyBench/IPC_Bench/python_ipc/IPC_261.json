  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a Kafka producer function that reads data from a CSV file and sends it as JSON messages to a specified Kafka topic, with special commit markers before and after the data transmission.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes a connection to a Kafka broker, reads movie rating data from a CSV file, converts each record to JSON format, and sends them to a predefined Kafka topic. It sends a \"*COMMIT*\" marker before and after the data transmission to indicate the start and end of the dataset. The function includes delays to ensure proper message delivery and resource cleanup.\n\nInput: None (The function uses hardcoded values for the Kafka broker configuration and file path)\n\nOutput: None (The function's effect is the messages sent to the Kafka topic)",
