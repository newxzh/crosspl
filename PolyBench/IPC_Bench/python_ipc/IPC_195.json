  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Flask-based HTTP server endpoint that processes incoming POST requests containing a URL, executes a curl command to fetch the URL's content, and returns the fetched content as the response.\n\nFunction Description: The function handles Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability demonstration by accepting a URL via POST request, executing it through system curl command, and returning the response. This is for educational purposes only to demonstrate SSRF risks.\n\nInput: \n- HTTP POST request with form data containing a 'url' parameter (string) representing the target URL to fetch\n\nOutput:\n- Raw content (bytes) obtained from the curl command execution against the provided URL, returned as the HTTP response\n\nNote: The reference code shows a security anti-pattern (unsafe SSRF) and should only be used in controlled environments for educational purposes. In production, such functionality would require strict input validation and security controls.",
