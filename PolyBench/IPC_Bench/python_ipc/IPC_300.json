  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that executes a shell command using Python's subprocess module and returns the output, error, and process object.\n\nFunction Description: The function SC (Shell Command) takes a shell command as input, executes it using subprocess.Popen, and captures both the standard output and standard error streams. It returns a tuple containing these outputs along with the process object for further interaction if needed.\n\nInput: \n- cmd: [str] - The shell command to be executed as a string.\n\nOutput: \n- Returns a tuple containing:\n  - out: [bytes] - The standard output of the executed command.\n  - err: [bytes] - The standard error of the executed command.\n  - proc: [subprocess.Popen] - The process object representing the executed command.",
