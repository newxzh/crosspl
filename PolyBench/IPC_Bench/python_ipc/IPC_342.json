  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that establishes a TCP client connection to a server, sends a message, and continuously receives responses from the server.\n\nFunction Description: The function `tcp_client_communication` creates a TCP socket, connects to a specified server, sends a predefined or custom message, and enters a loop to continuously receive and print responses from the server until manually interrupted. The connection is closed after the loop exits (though in practice, the loop is infinite and `s.close()` may not be reached).\n\nInput:\n- `host` (str, optional): The IP address or hostname of the target server. Defaults to \"localhost\".\n- `port` (int, optional): The port number of the target server. Defaults to 5001.\n- `message` (bytes, optional): The message to send to the server. Defaults to a predefined GPS tracker message in bytes format.\n\nOutput: None (The function prints received data to the console but does not return any value).",
