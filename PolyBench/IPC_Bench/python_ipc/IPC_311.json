  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a set of utility functions for executing shell commands in Python using subprocess.PIPE for inter-process communication, with options for real-time output display and logging.\n\nFunction Description: The functions provide different ways to execute shell commands and handle their output:\n1. run_command - Executes a command and collects all output lines\n2. run_shell_display - Executes a command and displays output in real-time\n3. run_shell - Executes a command and logs output to a file\n\nInput:\n- For run_command: cmd [str] - The shell command to execute\n- For run_shell_display: cmd [str] - The shell command to execute\n- For run_shell: cmd [str] - The shell command to execute, log_file [str] - Path to log file\n\nOutput:\n- For run_command: [str] - Combined stdout/stderr output\n- For run_shell_display: None (output is displayed in real-time)\n- For run_shell: [bytes] - Raw command output (also written to log file)",
