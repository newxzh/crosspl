  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a TCP client class in Python that can connect to a server, send commands, and receive responses, including handling acknowledgment messages.\n\nClass Description: The TCPClient class establishes a TCP connection to a specified server and provides functionality to send commands and receive responses. It handles both text and binary data, and automatically closes the connection when done.\n\nAttributes:\n- sock: [socket.socket] - The TCP socket object used for communication with the server\n\nMethods:\n- __init__(port: int) -> None - Initializes the TCP client and connects to the specified port on localhost\n- send_commands(commands: list) -> None - Sends each command in the list to the server and prints the responses until receiving either an <ACK> or <NAK> message for each command",
