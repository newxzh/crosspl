  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a RabbitMQ message consumer function in Python using the pika library to receive and process messages from a specified queue.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes a connection to a RabbitMQ server, declares a topic exchange and a queue, binds them together, and starts consuming messages. Each received message is processed by a callback function that prints the message body.\n\nInput:\n- port: [int] - The port number of the RabbitMQ server to connect to (default is typically 5672)\n\nOutput: None (The function runs indefinitely, consuming messages until interrupted)",
