  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python class that acts as a TCP client to interact with a Zookeeper server, retrieve statistics, and parse them into a structured format.\n\nClass Description: The ZookeeperTCPClient class provides functionality to connect to a Zookeeper server via TCP (either IPv4 or Unix socket), send commands, receive statistics, and parse them into a dictionary format while handling connection errors gracefully.\n\nAttributes: \n[No explicit attributes are defined in the class, as it's primarily method-based]\n\nMethods:\n\nMethod1: get_raw_stats(host, port) -> str - \nEstablishes a TCP connection to the specified Zookeeper server (either via IPv4 or Unix socket), sends the 'mntr' command, and returns the raw statistics data as a string.\nInput:\n- host: str - The server hostname/IP address or Unix socket path\n- port: str/int - The server port number (None for Unix socket connections)\nOutput:\n- str - Raw statistics data received from the server\n\nMethod2: get_stats(host, port) -> dict - \nRetrieves raw statistics using get_raw_stats(), parses them into a structured dictionary format while ignoring certain predefined fields, and attempts to find maximum connection limit from process information.\nInput:\n- host: str - The server hostname/IP address or Unix socket path\n- port: str/int - The server port number (None for Unix socket connections)\nOutput:\n- dict - Parsed statistics with metric names as keys and their values as values",
