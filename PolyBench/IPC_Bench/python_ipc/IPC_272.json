  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that implements an MQTT subscriber using the Paho MQTT client library to connect to a broker, subscribe to topics, and continuously process incoming messages.\n\nFunction Description: The function `mqtt_subscriber` establishes a connection to an MQTT broker, subscribes to specified topics, and enters a loop to continuously handle incoming messages. It includes logging for debugging purposes.\n\nInput: None (The broker address, port, and topic are hardcoded in the function for simplicity, but could be parameterized if needed.)\n\nOutput: None (The function runs indefinitely, processing incoming messages and logging events.)",
