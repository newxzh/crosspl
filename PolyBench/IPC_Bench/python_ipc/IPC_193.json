  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Flask-based web application that handles file uploads, processes the uploaded file to generate predictions, and displays the results.\n\nFunction Description: The application consists of two main routes: one for displaying the upload form and another for handling file uploads and processing. The first route renders the homepage with an upload form, while the second route handles POST requests, saves uploaded files securely, processes them to get predictions, and flashes the results to the user.\n\nInput:\n- For index() function: None (handles GET requests to root URL)\n- For submit_file() function: \n  - request.files: A dictionary-like object containing uploaded files (expects a 'file' key)\n  - request.url: The URL from which the request originated (used for redirects)\n\nOutput:\n- For index() function: Rendered HTML template ('index.html')\n- For submit_file() function: \n  - Redirects to root URL after processing\n  - Flashes messages containing:\n    - The prediction result (label)\n    - The full path of the saved file\n  - Error messages if no file is provided or selected\n\nNote: The functions interact with the following external components:\n- A prediction function (getPrediction) that takes a filename and returns a label\n- Flask's flash system for displaying messages\n- File system operations for saving uploaded files\n- Security utilities for sanitizing filenames",
