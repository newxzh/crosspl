  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement an MQTT subscriber client in Python using the Paho MQTT library to connect to a broker, subscribe to topics, and handle incoming messages.\n\nFunction Description: The function `mqtt_subscribe` establishes a connection to an MQTT broker, subscribes to specified topics, and continuously listens for incoming messages. It utilizes callback functions to handle connection events, subscription acknowledgments, and incoming messages.\n\nInput: None (The broker address, port, and topic are hardcoded in the function for simplicity, but could be parameterized for flexibility.)\n\nOutput: None (The function prints connection status, subscription acknowledgments, and received messages to the console.)\n\n---\n\nTask Description: Create a Python class that encapsulates MQTT subscriber functionality using the Paho MQTT library, allowing for connection to a broker, topic subscription, and message handling.\n\nClass Description: The `MQTTSubscriber` class provides methods to connect to an MQTT broker, subscribe to topics, and process incoming messages. It uses callback methods to handle connection events, subscription acknowledgments, and message reception.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `client`: [mqtt.Client] - The MQTT client instance used for communication with the broker.\n- `broker_address`: [str] - The address of the MQTT broker to connect to.\n- `broker_port`: [int] - The port number of the MQTT broker.\n- `topic`: [str] - The topic to subscribe to for receiving messages.\n\nMethods:\n\n- `__init__(self, broker_address: str, broker_port: int, topic: str) -> None` - Initializes the MQTT subscriber with broker details and subscription topic.\n- `on_connect(self, mqttc, obj, flags, reason_code, properties) -> None` - Callback for when the client connects to the broker.\n- `on_message(self, mqttc, obj, msg) -> None` - Callback for when a message is received on a subscribed topic.\n- `on_subscribe(self, mqttc, obj, mid, reason_code_list, properties) -> None` - Callback for when the client subscribes to a topic.\n- `connect_and_subscribe(self) -> None` - Connects to the broker and subscribes to the specified topic.\n- `start(self) -> None` - Starts the MQTT loop to process network traffic and messages.",
