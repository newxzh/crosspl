  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create an asynchronous HTTP client function that can send various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS) and return the response.\n\nFunction Description: The function `make_http_request` is an asynchronous HTTP client that sends HTTP requests using the `httpx` library. It supports multiple HTTP methods and can handle both raw content and JSON data for POST requests. The function uses a context manager to ensure proper resource management and returns the HTTP response object.\n\nInput:\n- `url`: str - The target URL for the HTTP request.\n- `method`: str (optional, default=\"GET\") - The HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS).\n- `content`: typing.Optional[bytes] (optional) - Raw bytes content to send in the request body (for POST, PUT, PATCH).\n- `json`: typing.Optional[dict] (optional) - JSON data to send in the request body (for POST).\n- `headers`: typing.Optional[dict] (optional) - Custom headers to include in the request.\n\nOutput:\n- `httpx.Response` - The HTTP response object containing status code, headers, and response body.",
