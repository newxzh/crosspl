  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a Python function that sends a TCP payload to a specified target server using socket programming.\n\nFunction Description: The function establishes a TCP connection to a target server using IPv4, constructs an HTTP GET request with the provided payload, sends the request to the server, and then closes the connection. This is useful for testing TCP-based services or sending crafted HTTP requests.\n\nInput:\n- target_ip: [str] - The IP address of the target server to connect to\n- target_port: [int] - The port number on the target server to connect to\n- payload: [str] - The data to be included in the HTTP GET request path\n\nOutput: None (The function performs an action but doesn't return any value)",
