  "Instruction": "Task Description: Create a function that executes a system command using Python's subprocess module with pipe-based inter-process communication.\n\nFunction Description: The function should take a system command as input, execute it in a subprocess, capture the output through a pipe, and return the decoded output string. It should handle the process creation, communication, and cleanup automatically.\n\nInput: \n- com: [str] - The system command to be executed as a string\n\nOutput:\n- [str] - The decoded output from the executed command, as a string",
