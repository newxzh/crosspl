  "Instruction": "Task Description: Implement a function that listens for a multicast token over UDP, decodes the received message, and extracts the token value.\n\nFunction Description: The function continuously listens on a specified UDP port for incoming messages containing a token. When a valid message is received, it parses the message, extracts the token, and stores it in a global variable. The function handles socket creation, binding, timeout, and cleanup, and runs in a loop until a token is received or a cancellation flag is set.\n\nInput: None (uses global variables `multicast_token` and `cancel_thread` for state management)\n\nOutput: None (updates the global variable `multicast_token` with the received token if successful)",
