You are a senior software engineer with deep expertise in multi-language interoperability and inter-process communication (IPC) technologies.

Your task is to analyze the provided "Source code", which is written in {PL}.

Please determine whether the LLM can accurately extract either function-level code, or class-level code, which contains a  complete implementation of the {IPC_Name} technique.Judgment rules are as follows:
1. according to the source code, if the key steps of using this inter-process communication technology can be completed in one function, extract the function-level code;
2. according to the source code, if this inter-process communication technology requires multiple functions to implement, extract the class-level code.
3. if there is no suitable class-level code or function-level code in the source code that can accurately implement the inter-process communication technology, extract nothing and return "null".
4. In Go, function-level code refers to standalone functions that are not bound to any struct, focusing solely on performing specific tasks or operations independently, class-level code refers to code centered around a struct type and its associated methodsâ€”serving as the Go equivalent of a class in other languages.

The key steps required for a valid {IPC_Name} implementation are:
{Steps}

Source code:
{Original_code}

Your judgment is: (Your answer can only contain one of the following: "Function-level" or "Class-level" or "null". Please don't include any other characters, and do not give me the reason for your judgment.)
