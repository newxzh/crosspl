Task description:
Based on the original code and information related to the original code, extract the expected class-level(In Go, class-level code refers to code centered around a struct type and its associated methodsâ€”serving as the Go equivalent of a class in other languages.) code for multi-programming language interaction from the original code.

Requirements:
1. Only extract one class-level code involving multi-programming language interaction in the original code, including struct, all relevant functions, parameters, return values and core logic.
2. Extract all external library files and global variables that use the class, and ensure that these codes are completely derived from the original code.
3. Only extract task-related code, do not extract the comments from the code, and the extracted code must strictly contain the key steps of the inter-process communication technology.
4. The output result should follow the format of "Output" in the example. Do not include any characters other than code, including "Output", "Go", " ''' ", or "Here's the extracted...".
5. Please strictly follow the instructions above.

Instruct:
You are an advanced programmer who focuses on multi-language interaction and inter-process communication technology.
Please complete the task according to the following example.

Example:
Input:
Original code: {Reference_raw_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: Go
  - Inter-process communication technology name: Simple Rabbitmq consumer in go
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology:
    Step 1: Import the streadway/amqp package
    Step 2: Connect to the RabbitMQ server
    Step 3: Create a channel for communication
    Step 4: Declare the exchange to bind the queue (if needed)
    Step 5: Declare the queue from which to consume messages
    Step 6: Bind the queue to the exchange with a routing key
    Step 7: Start consuming messages from the queue

Output:
{Reference_class_level_code}

Request:
Now please follow the task description and the example to extract one expected multi-language interaction class-level code from the original code based on the input.

Input:
Original code: {Original_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: {PL}
  - Inter-process communication technology name: {IPC_Name}
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology: {Steps}
