Task description:
Based on the original code and information related to the original code, extract the expected function-level code for multi-programming language interaction from the original code.

Requirements:
1. Only extract one function-level code involving multi-programming language interaction in the original code, including function name, parameters, return value and core logic.
2. Extract all external library files and global variables that use the function, and ensure that these codes are completely derived from the original code.
3. Only extract task-related code, do not extract the comments from the code, and the extracted code must strictly contain the key steps of the inter-process communication technology.
4. The output result should follow the format of "Output" in the example. Do not include any characters other than code, including "Output", "Go", " ''' ", or "Here's the extracted...".
5. Please strictly follow the instructions above.

Instruct:
You are an advanced programmer who focuses on multi-language interaction and inter-process communication technology.
Please complete the task according to the following example.

Example:
Input:
Original code: {Reference_raw_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: Go
  - Inter-process communication technology name: Official-based gRPC server in Go
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology:
    Step 1: Import gRPC package
    Step 2: Set up a network listener
    Step 3: Create a new gRPC server instance
    Step 4: Start the server to listen for incoming requests

Output:
{Reference_function_level_code}

Request:
Now please follow the task description and the example to extract one expected multi-language interaction function-level code from the original code based on the input.

Input:
Original code: {Original_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: {PL}
  - Inter-process communication technology name: {IPC_Name}
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology: {Steps}
