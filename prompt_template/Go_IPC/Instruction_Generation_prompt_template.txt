You are a senior programmer specializing in multilingual interaction and inter-process communication (IPC) technologies.
Please carefully analyze the "Reference code", which is written in {PL} and utilizes the {IPC_Name} technique. The key steps of this technique include {Steps}.

Reference code:
{Canonical_solution}

If the reference code is at the function level, Please write a clear instruction detailing the function, including its purpose, input parameters (if any), and output (if any), to guide an LLM in generating reference code.
Use the following format to structure your instruction(Finally, please strictly follow the format requirements and do not insert any characters that are not relevant to the requirements.):

Task Description:...

Function Description:...

Input:...

Output:...

If the reference code is at the class level(struct level), please write a clear instruction describing the struct, including its purpose, fields, and associated methods (with input and output types). This instruction should guide an LLM to generate struct-level Go code.

Use the following format to structure your instruction (Finally, please strictly follow the format requirements and do not insert any characters that are not relevant to the requirements.):

Task Description: ...

Struct Description: ...

Fields:

Field1: [Data Type] - [Description]
Field2: [Data Type] - [Description]

Methods:

Method1: [Name]([Input Parameters]) -> [Return Type] - [Description]
Method2: [Name]([Input Parameters]) -> [Return Type] - [Description]
