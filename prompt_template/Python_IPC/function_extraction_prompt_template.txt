Task description:
Based on the original code and information related to the original code, extract the expected function-level code for multi-programming language interaction from the original code.

Requirements:
1. Only extract function-level code involving multi-programming language interaction in the original code, including function name, parameters, return value and core logic.
2. According to the original code, if there are no functions or classes, and the key steps can be completed solely within the script-level code, please extract the code and encapsulate the code into a function-level code, preserve the original semantics of the code as much as possible; do not introduce any content other than encapsulation
3. Extract all external library files and global variables that use the function, and ensure that these codes are completely derived from the original code.
4. Only extract task-related code, and the extracted code must strictly contain the key steps of the inter-process communication technology.
5. The output result should follow the format of "Output" in the example. Do not include any characters other than code, including "Output", "Python", " ''' ", or "Here's the extracted...".
6. Please strictly follow the instructions above.

Instruct:
You are an advanced programmer who focuses on multi-language interaction and inter-process communication technology.
Please complete the task according to the following example.

Example:
Input:
Original code: {Reference_raw_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: Python
  - Inter-process communication technology name: TCP Server - side by using socket in python
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology:
    Step 1: Import the socket module
    Step 2: Create a TCP socket object using IPv4
    Step 3: Connect the socket to the target server's IP and port
    Step 4: Send data to or receive data from the server
    Step 5: Close the connection with the server

Output:
{Reference_function_level_code}

Request:
Now please follow the task description and the example to extract one expected multi-language interaction function-level code from the original code based on the input.

Input:
Original code: {Original_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: {PL}
  - Inter-process communication technology name: {IPC_Name}
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology: {Steps}
