You will see a piece of Python code that calls a C function from a dynamic library. Your task is to generate a unit test program based on Pytest for the given Python code.

Guidelines:

1. **Generate corresponding unit tests:**
   - For each C function call, write unit tests that validate the input and output of the function.

2. **Test coverage:**
   - Mock or create input data to test the function's behavior.
   - Ensure the test covers typical cases, edge cases, and potential exceptions.

3. **Assertions:**
   - Use Pytest's assertion methods to check that the return values are correct.

4. **Handle data type conversions:**
   - Ensure proper handling of data type conversions between Python and C (e.g., `ctypes`).

5. **All functions used in the generated unit tests must be defined:**

   - Do not use or refer to any functions that do not exist in the provided code.

   - Ensure that every function, including the one being tested, is explicitly defined.

   - The function being tested must be part of the provided code, either directly or indirectly.



5. **Output requirements:**
   - **Return only the code.**
   - Do **not** include any explanations, comments, or unrelated content.
   - The generated tests must use Pytest and unittest.
