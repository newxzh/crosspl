Task description:
Based on the original code and information related to the original code, extract the expected class-level code for multi-programming language interaction from the original code.

Requirements:
1. Only extract one class-level code involving multi-programming language interaction in the original code, including Class name, all relevant functions, parameters, return values and core logic.
2. According to the source code, if the inter-process communication technique requires multiple functions to work together, but the source code does not define any classes and only uses several functions in a script-style structure, please encapsulate it into a single class, and then extract the class-level code, Preserve the original semantics of the code as much as possible, do not introduce any content other than encapsulation.
3. Extract all external library files and global variables that use the class, and ensure that these codes are completely derived from the original code.
4. Only extract task-related code, and the extracted code must strictly contain the key steps of the inter-process communication technology.
5. The output result should follow the format of "Output" in the example. Do not include any characters other than code, including "Output", "c++","C++", " ''' ", or "Here's the extracted...".
6. Please strictly follow the instructions above.

Instruct:
You are an advanced programmer who focuses on multi-language interaction and inter-process communication technology.
Please complete the task according to the following example.

Example:
Input:
Original code: {Reference_raw_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: C++
  - Inter-process communication technology name: TCP Server based on Boost.Asio in C++
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology:
    Step 1: Include Boost.Asio headers to use asynchronous I/O for TCP server.
    Step 2: Create an `io_context` object which provides the core I/O functionality.
    Step 3: Create a `tcp::acceptor` object (if needed) to accept incoming TCP connections on a specified endpoint.
    Step 4: Create a `tcp::socket` object to handle communication with the client after a connection is accepted.
    Step 5: Use `acceptor.accept()` to accept an incoming connection from the client.
    Step 6: Write data to the socket using `write()` and read data using `read_some()` to process client messages.
    Step 7: Shutdown the connection and close the socket once communication is complete.

Output:
{Reference_class_level_code}

Request:
Now please follow the task description and the example to extract one expected multi-language interaction class-level code from the original code based on the input.

Input:
Original code: {Original_code}
Information related to the original code:
  - Programming language: {PL}
  - Inter-process communication technology name: {IPC_Name}
  - The key steps of this inter-process communication technology: {Steps}
